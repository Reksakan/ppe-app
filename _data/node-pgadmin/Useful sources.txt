1. Command to run migration (for table creation) - same in SQL as CREATE table

npm run migrate 

Note: 
a. run it on server side.
b. take a look video cause you need to create a file *.js or *.cjs in the 'migrations' folder;

2. Command to run seeds (for data uploading into table) - same in SQL INPUT

npm run seed
Note: 
a. run it on server side.
b. take a look video cause you need to create a file dev.js or dev.cjs in the 'seeds' folder;

npm run migrate
